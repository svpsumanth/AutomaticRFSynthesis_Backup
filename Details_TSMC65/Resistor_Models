In the sheet Resister_Models,

Provided Data,

1. Model Name
2. Model's Sheet Resistance
3. Temperature Variation Parameters (ptc1 and ptc2)

	Here ptc1 is Linear Temp Coefficient and ptc is Quadratic Coefficient

	Given ptc,ptc and resistance at 25C (by default),

		Resistance=R_25*(1 + (temp-25)*ptc1 + ptc2*(temp-25)^2 )  \
	
	(This is how spectre calculates Resistance vs Temperature)
